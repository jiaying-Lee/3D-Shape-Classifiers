# 3D-Shape-Classifiers

In this project we implemented `PointNet`, `VoxNet` and `Multi-view CNN` that classify 3D shapes.

All these three models achieved multiclass classification on `ModelNet10`.

Implementation code could be found in each folder. You are encouraged to run the `.ipynb` file in `Google Colab` with `GPU` runtime.
